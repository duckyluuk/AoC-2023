# Advent Of Code

My 2023 Advent of Code submissions.
(https://adventofcode.com/)

## Structure
### Utils
The `utils` folder contains a lot of useful functions for things like:
- Reading input
- Parsing data
- Math functions
- Graph functions
- etc.

These are to try to help solve the problems in less time.

### Problems
There will be a folder for each week. Each folder will contain 3 files:
- `{NUM}.txt`
- `{NUM}.py`
- `{NUM}_golfed.py`

The .txt file has the input for the problem, and the .py file has my original solution to the problem.
This year I will also try to golf a solution to the problem as much as possible. My smallest solutions are in the _golfed.py files.
